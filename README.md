# Big-Integer-Cpp-library
C++ Big Integer library for programming contests and medium scale computations

What is included:

Basic integer operations:

1. Addition and subtraction of two numbers in O(N + M) time

2. Multiplication of two numbers in O(max(N, M)^1.58) time using Karatsuba's algorithm

3. Division and modulo of two numbers in O(N * M) time

4. Conversion of data types, manipulations on integers

Extra:

1. Bitwise operations: and/or/xor/not/...

2. Binary shifts

3. Math functions:

a. min/max operators

b. square root calculation in O(N^(1 + 1.58)) using binary search (other faster methods can be used here)

c. cube root calculation

d. large factorials, checking if a number is a factorial of some nonnegative integer

e. GCD, LCM, modular inverse, and some other number theory methods
